# Emotion Detection Music Player

This is one of my practice projects, built with Python. The script detects emotions from facial expressions and plays music from a folder(music).It's a simple program that identifies emotions from facial expressions and then plays music that fits the mood .
For the time being, I have given only 3 moods: sad, happy, and neutral.

Feel free to check out the code and experiment with it!
